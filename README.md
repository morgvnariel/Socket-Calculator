# Socket-Calculator
In this programming assignment, you will implement client-server socket communication as we discussed in the lecture. Both client and server will be run on eustis.eecs.ucf.edu (by now you should know how to login Eustis server). Therefore, you would need two processes, namely a client process and a server process, to realize the socket communication. You can use C/C++, Java, and Python to program this project.  Eustis supports all these programming languages.  In this assignment, you will implement a basic calculator. The server will run first. The client program will repeatedly prompt the user to enter a basic math question such as 3.5+5. This math question will be sent to the server. The server calculates the math question and sends the answer back to the client. The client program will display the answer on the screen.
